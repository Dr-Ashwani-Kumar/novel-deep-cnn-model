## <div align="center"> PROJECT TITLE</div>
## A Novel Skin Cancer Detection Model using Modified Finch Deep CNN Classifier Model
<br>

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
<br>
    OS-Windows 11
<br>
    RAM-16GB
<br>
    ROM-More than 100 GB
<br>
    CPU-1.7 Ghz
<br>

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

<b>Software name: </b> Python: Version: <b>3.9</b>([Download link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/))<br>
<b>Software name: </b> Pycharm: Version: <b>2023.2.1</b>([Download link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows))
<br>

## HOW TO RUN
    Step 1: Loading the project in PYCHARM
<br>
    1. Open pycharm
<br>
    2. Go to File, select Open browse the project from your drive and select it. So that the
    project will get loaded into the Pycharm.
<br>
    3. For the first time, Pycharm will take some time to load the settings.
<br>
    4. Please wait if any process is loading at the bottom of the screen.
<br>
    5. Check the Project Interpreter (File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Project Interpreter).
    If this location “(C:\Users\---\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe) is
    not presented, then add this ‘python.exe’ from the installed location.
<br>
    Step 2: Generate the graphs plotted in the paper
<br>
    1. current project window in pycharm, Open ‘Main.py’, and click
    run button.
<br>
    2. When you execute this it will ask you to select anyone from two options like Yes (“Full
    analysis +Plots”) and NO (“Plots from pre evaluated data”).
<br>
    3. · If you select the first option, it will execute the complete analysis again and
    display the results. It may take time depending on the analysis.
<br>
    4. · Second option will display the results from the stored data i.e, mainly to skip the
    execution time.
<br>
    [Execution time expected: “Full analysis +Plots” — 48 hr]
<br>
    [Execution time expected: “Plots from pre evaluated data” – 30 sec]
<br>
